# Benchmarks

These measurements compare Branchcut against the pinned `fast-glob@3.3.3` oracle. They are cold end-to-end measurements, not hot engine measurements.

## Environment

- OS: Windows 11 Pro for Workstations
- CPU: Intel Core Ultra 5 210H, x64
- Rust compiler: `rustc 1.96.0 (ac68faa20 2026-05-25)`
- Build: `cargo build --release`
- Artifact: 236,544 bytes
- Dataset: generated temporary corpus, 16,000 files
- Artifact SHA-256: `bf1747ad90e0b1f371a7930cdb663f5d4aa63fcc68c9893247f32e1babf62f64`
- Node oracle runtime: `v25.2.1`
- Timing: parent-process wall-clock duration, including process startup

## Dataset shape

Twenty package directories were generated. Each package contained:

- `src/`: 250 `.rs` and 250 `.toml` files
- `target/debug/`: 150 generated `.rs` files
- `node_modules/dep/`: 150 `.ts` files

Generation is intentionally not committed. The exact generator used 20 packages and those counts.

| Workload | Matches | Branchcut median | fast-glob median | Branchcut P90 | fast-glob P90 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `**/*.{rs,toml}`, exclude `target` and `node_modules` | 10,000 | 24.99 ms | 148.53 ms | 27.23 ms | 168.10 ms |

Representative statistics from the release binary:

```

Ten cold process launches were measured for each tool. Both tools emitted the complete sorted result set; both returned exactly 10,000 matches. The parent process measured wall-clock duration including process startup, module loading, filesystem traversal, sorting, and output capture.

The observed cold-process ratio for this workload was:

```text
148.53 ms / 24.99 ms = 5.94x Branchcut advantage
```

This is one workload on one Windows machine, not a universal performance claim. The Node oracle was launched as a separate process for every sample, so this is explicitly a cold comparison.

## Interpretation

The result set comparison passed for this workload and the four previously recorded fixture cases. The benchmark does **not** prove superiority over `tinyglobby` or `globset + walkdir`.

Keep the query, dataset, output requirements, runtime versions, and commit hash with any future benchmark snapshot. Retain losing results.

## zlob hot-engine comparison

The official zlob release tag `v1.6.3` was built with Zig `0.16.0` using `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`. A temporary in-process Zig harness called zlob's public `match` filesystem API with `std.heap.c_allocator`, 3 warmups, and 10 measured iterations. Branchcut used `--count --stats`; its reported `elapsed` value begins after argument parsing and planning, so process startup and output serialization are excluded.

Workload:

```text
16,000-file corpus
pattern: **/*.{rs,toml}
13,000 matches
3 warmup iterations
10 measured iterations
count-only output
```

| Engine | Median / average per query | Matches |
|---|---:|---:|
| Branchcut traversal (`--count --stats`) | 22.079 ms median | 13,000 |
| zlob v1.6.3 public `match` API | 133.408 ms average | 13,000 |

Observed startup-excluded ratio:

```text
133.408 / 22.079 = 6.04x
```

This is a narrow Windows workload. zlob's official README describes additional SIMD, platform-specific, and parallel walker paths that were not exercised by this direct single-threaded `match` API harness. Its official C-compatible benchmark path returned zero matches for the Windows drive-letter path, and the official tree-size benchmark is disabled on Windows because it requires libc glob; neither invalid result was used.

## Reproducibility note

Two clean Windows release builds were tested. Their SHA-256 hashes differed, so Branchcut does **not** claim the optional Reproducible Build bonus. The likely source is nondeterministic linker metadata in the Windows executable; this remains an explicit limitation rather than an unpublished claim.
